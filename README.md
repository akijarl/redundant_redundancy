# redundant_redundancy

Code used to generate simulations of multigenic quantitative trait redundancy, and quantify levels of said redundancy.

Files:
Redund_clean.R - R script containing simulation code written by Katie Lotterhos and code calculating C_chisquared scores written by Sam Yeaman with a wrapper written by Áki Jarl Láruson

Redund_clean.RData - R data file containing output results from four simulations (10 loci representing 100% of sampled genome, 10 loci representing 10% of genome, 50 loci as 100% of genome, and 50 loci as 10% of genome)

Folder:
figures - contains four figures depicting histograms of C_chisquared score values from the four simulations mentioned above
